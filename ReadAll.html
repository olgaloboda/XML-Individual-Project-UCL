                            "Now?"

                            "Soon."
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Do the scientists really know?
                                Will it happen today, will it?"

         </p>
         <p>The children pressed to each other
                            like so many roses, so many weeds, intermixed, peering out for a look at the hidden sun.
                            
         </p>
         <p>It rained.</p>
         <p>It had been raining for seven years; thousands upon thousands of days compounded and filled from one end to the other with
            rain, 
                            with the drum and gush of water, with the 
                            sweet crystal fall of showers and the concussion of storms so heavy they were 
                            tidal waves come over the islands. A thousand forests had been crushed under the rain and grown up a thousand
            times to be crushed again. 
                            And this was the way life was forever on the planet
                                
                                    Venus
                                , and this was the schoolroom of the children of the rocket men and women who had come to a raining world to set up civilization
            and 
                                live out their lives
                            .
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            
                                "It's stopping, it's stopping!"
                            
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            
                                "Yes, yes!"
                            
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            Margot stood apart from
                            them, from these children who could ever remember a time when there wasn't
                            rain and rain and rain. 
                            They were all nine years old, and if there had been a day, seven years ago, when
                            the sun came out for an hour and showed its face to the 
                            stunned world, they could not recall. Sometimes, at night,
                            she heard them stir, in remembrance, and 
                            she knew
                                they were
                                dreaming and rememberinggold or a yellow crayon or a coin large enough to buy the world with
                                .
                                She knew
                                they thought
                                they remembered a warmness, like a blushing
                                in the face, in the body, in the arms and legs and trembling hands. But then
                            they always awoke to the 
                            tatting drum, the endless shaking down of clear bead necklaces upon
                            the roof, the walk, the gardens,
                                the forests, and their dreamswere gone.
                        
         </p>
         <p>All day yesterday
                            they had read in class about the sun. About how
                            like a lemon it was, and how hot. And 
                            they had written small stories or essays or poems about it: 
                            <span style="font-style:italic">I think
                               the sun is a flower, That blooms for just one hour
                               </span>. That was
                            Margot's poem, read in a quiet voice in the still classroom while the rain was falling outside.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Aw, you didn't write that!" protested one of the boys.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "I did," said 
                            Margot. 
                            "I did."  
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            
                                "William!"
                             said the teacher.
                        
         </p>
         <p>But that was yesterday. Now the rain was slackening, and the children were crushed in the great thick windows.</p>
         <p>
                            "Where's teacher?"
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            
                                "She'll be back."
                                            
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            
                                "She'd better hurry, we'll miss it!"
                            
                        
         </p>
         <p>They turned on themselves,
                            like a feverish wheel, all tumbling spokes.
                            Margot stood alone.
                            She was a very frail girl who looked as if she had been lost in the rain for years and the rain had washed out
                                the blue from her eyes and the red from her mouth and the yellow from her hair.
                            She was an old photograph dusted from an album, whitened away
                            , and if she spoke at all her
                            would be a ghost. Now she stood, separate, staring at the rain and the
                            loud wet world beyond the huge glass.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "What're <span style="font-style:italic">you</span> looking at?" said
                            William.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            Margot said nothing.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Speak when you're spoken to."
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            He gave her a shove. But 
                            she did not move; rather
                            she let herself be moved only by him and nothing else.
                            They edged away from her,
                            they would not look at her.
                            She felt them go away. And this was because 
                            she would play no games with them in the echoing tunnels of the underground city. If they tagged her and ran, 
                            she stood 
                            blinking after them and did not follow. When the class sang songs about
                            happiness and life and games her lips barely moved.
                            Only when they sang about the sun and the summer did her lips move as she watched the drenched windows. And
            then, of course, the biggest crime of all was that
                            she had come here only five years ago from
                            
                                Earth
                            , and 
                            she remembered the sun and the way the sun was and the sky was when she was four in
                            
                                Ohio
                            .
                             And 
                                
                                    they,
                                    they
                                had been on
                                
                                    Venus
                                 all their lives, and 
                                
                                    they 
                                    they
                                had been only two years old when last the sun came out and had long since forgotten the
                                color and heat of it and the way it really was
                            .
                        
         </p>
         <p>But 
                            Margot remembered.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "It's
                                like a penny,"
                            
                            she said once, eyes closed.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "No it's not!" the children cried.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "It's
                                like a fire,"
                            
                            she said,
                            "in the stove."
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "You're lying, you don't remember!" cried the children.
                        
         </p>
         <p>But 
                            she remembered and stood quietly apart from all of them and watched the patterning windows. And once, a month ago,
                            she had refused to shower in the school shower rooms, had clutched her hands to her ears and over her head, 
                            screaming the water mustn't touch her head. So after that,
                            dimly, dimly,
                            she sensed it,
                            she was different and
                            they knew her difference and kept away. There was talk that her father and mother were taking her back to
                            
                                Earth
                             next year; it seemed vital to her that
                            they do so,though it would mean the loss of thousands of dollars to her family. And so, 
                            the children hated her for all these reasons of big and little consequence. 
                            They hated her
                            pale
                                    snow face, her waiting silence, her thinness, and her possible future
                                .
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Get away!" The boy gave her another push. 
                            "What're you waiting for?"
                        
         </p>
         <p>Then, for the first time,
                            she turned and looked at him. And 
                            what
                                she was waiting for was in her eyes
                            .
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Well, don't wait around here!" cried the boy savagely.
                            "You won't see nothing!"
                        
         </p>
         <p>Her lips moved.</p>
         <p>
                            "Nothing!"
                            he cried.
                            "It was all a joke, wasn't it?"
                             He turned to the other children.
                            "Nothing's happening today. <span style="font-style:italic">Is</span> it?"
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            They all 
                            blinked at him and then, understanding, laughed and shook their heads.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            
                                "Nothing, nothing!"
                            
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Oh, but," 
                            Margot 
                            whispered, her eyes
                            helpless.
                            "But this is the day, the scientists
                                 predict,
                                    they say,
                                    they know
                                ,
                                the sun..."
                            
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "All a joke!" said the boy, and seized her roughly.
                            "Hey, everyone, let's put her in a closet before the teacher comes!"
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "No," said
                            Margot, falling back.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            They
                             surged about her, caught her up and bore her,
                             protesting, and then pleading, and then crying, back into
                             a tunnel, a room, a closet, where
                            they slammed and locked the door.
                            They stood looking at the door and saw it tremble from her
                            beating and throwing herself against
                            it.
                            They heard her muffled cries. Then, smiling,
                            they turned and went out and back down the tunnel, just as the teacher arrived.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Ready, children?"
                            She glanced at her watch.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Yes!" said everyone.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Are we all here?"
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Yes!"
                        
         </p>
         <p>The rain slacked still more.</p>
         <p>
                            They crowded to the huge door.
                        
         </p>
         <p>The rain stopped.</p>
         <p>It was as if, in the midst of a film concerning
                            an avalanche, a tornado, a hurricane, a volcanic eruption,
                            something had, first, gone wrong with the sound apparatus, thus 
                                muffling and finally cutting off 
                                all noise, all of the blasts and repercussions and thunders, and then, second, ripped the film from the projector and inserted in its place 
                            a beautiful tropical slide which did not move or tremor. The world ground to a standstill. The silence was
            so immense and unbelievable that you 
                            felt your ears had been stuffed or you had lost your hearing altogether. The children put their hands to their
            ears.
                            They stood apart.
                            The door slid back and
                            the smell of the silent, waiting world came in to them.
         </p>
         <p>The sun came out.</p>
         <p>
                            It was the color of flaming bronze and
                            it was very large. And the sky around
                            it was a blazing blue tile color. And
                            the jungle burned with sunlight as the children,
                            released from their spell, rushed out, yelling into the springtime.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Now, don't go too far," called the teacher after them.
                            "You've only two hours, you know. You wouldn't want to get caught out!"
                        
         </p>
         <p>But 
                            they were running and turning their faces up to the sky and feeling the sun on their cheeks
                                like a warm iron;
                                they were taking off their jackets and
                                letting the sun burn their arms.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Oh, it's better than the sun lamps, isn't it?"
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            
                                "Much, much better!"
                            
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            They stopped running and stood in the great jungle that covered
                            
                                Venus
                            , that grew and never stopped growing, tumultuously, even as you watched
                            it.
                            
                            
                            It was a nest of octopi, clustering up great arms of 
                                    fleshlike weed, wavering, flowering in this brief spring
                                .
                                 It was the color of rubber and ash, this
                                jungle, from the many years without sun.
                                It was the color of stones and white cheeses and ink, and 
                                it was the color of the moon
                            .
                        
         </p>
         <p>The children lay out, laughing, on the
                            jungle mattress, and heard it sigh and 
                                squeak under them resilient and alive
                            .
                            They ran among the trees,
                            they slipped and fell,
                            they pushed each other,
                            they played hide-and-seek and tag, but most of all them squinted at the sun until the tears ran down their faces;
                            they put their hands up to that
                            yellowness and that amazing
                            blueness and
                            they breathed of the
                            fresh, fresh air
                            and listened and listened to the silence which suspended them in a
                                blessed sea of no sound and no motion.
                            They looked at everything and savored everything
                            . Then, wildly,
                            like animals escaped from their caves,
                            theyran and ran in
                                shouting circles.
                                They ran for an hour and did not stop running
                            .
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            And then-
                            
         </p>
         <p>In the midst of their running one of the girls wailed.</p>
         <p>Everyone stopped.</p>
         <p>The girl, standing in the open, held out her hand.</p>
         <p>
                            "Oh,
                                look, look,"
                            
                            she said, trembling.    
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            They came slowly to look at her opened palm.
                        
         </p>
         <p>In the center of
                            it,
                            cupped and huge, was a single raindrop.
                            She began to cry, looking at
                            it.
                            They glanced quietly at the sun.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            
                                "Oh. Oh."
                            
                        
         </p>
         <p>A few cold drops fell on their noses and their cheeks and their mouths. The sun faded behind a stir of mist. A wind blew cold
            around them.
                            They turned and started to walk back toward the underground house, their hands at their sides, their smiles 
                            vanishing away.
                        
         </p>
         <p>A boom of thunder startled them and
                            like leaves before a new hurricane,
                            they tumbled upon each other and ran.
                            Lightning struck ten miles away, five miles away, a mile, a half mile. The sky darkened into 
                            midnight in a flash.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            They stood in the doorway of the underground for a moment until it was raining hard. Then
                            they closed the door and heard the
                            gigantic sound of the rain falling in tons and avalanches, everywhere and forever.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Will it be seven more years?"
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Yes. Seven."
                        
         </p>
         <p>Then one of them gave a little cry.</p>
         <p>
                            
                                "Margot!"
                            
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "What?"
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "She's still in the closet where we locked her."
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            
                                "Margot."
                            
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            They stood as if someone had driven them,
                            like so many stakes, into the floor.
                            They looked at each other and then looked away.
                                They glanced out at the world that was
                                raining now and raining and rainingsteadily.
                                They could not meet each other's glances. Their faces were
                                solemn and pale.
                                They looked at their hands and feet, their faces down
                            .
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            
                                "Margot."
                            
                        
         </p>
         <p>One of the girls said,
                            "Well...?"
                        
         </p>
         <p>No one moved.</p>
         <p>
                            "Go on," whispered the girl.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            They walked slowly down the hall in the sound of cold rain.
                            They turned through the doorway to the room in the sound of the storm and thunder, lightning on their faces,
                            blue and terrible. 
                            They walked over to the closet door slowly and stood by
                            it.
                        
         </p>
         <p>Behind the closet door was only silence.</p>

                            They unlocked the door, even more slowly, and let
                            Margot out.

         <h3>The Dragon</h3>
         <h4>

         </h4>
         <p>The night blew in the short grass on the moor; there was no other motion.
                            It had been years since a single bird had flown by in the great blind shell of sky.
                        
         </p>
         <p>Long ago 
                            a few small stones had simulated life when they crumbled and fell into dust. Now only the 
                             night moved in the souls of the two men
                            bent by their
                            lonely fire in the wilderness; 
                            darkness pumped quietly in their veins and ticked silently in their temples and their wrists. 
                        
         </p>
         <p>Firelight fled up and down their 
                            wild faces and welled in their eyes
                            in orange tatters. 
                            They listened to each other's faint
                            , cool breathing and the
                            lizard blink of their eyelids. At last, one man poked the fire with his sword.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Don't idiot; you'll give us away!"
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "No matter," said the second man, 
                            "The dragon can smell us miles off anyway. God's breath, it's cold. I wish I was back at the castle."
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            
                                "It's death, not sleep, we're after..."
                            
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Why? Why? The dragon never sets foot in the town!"
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Quiet, fool! He eats men traveling alone from our town to the next!"
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Let them be eaten and let us get home!"
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Wait now; listen!"
                        
         </p>
         <p>The
                            two men froze.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            They waited a long time, but there was only the shake of their horses'
                            nervous skin
                            like black velvet tambourines
                                jingling the silver stirrup buckles,
                            softly, softly.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Ah." The second man sighed."What
                                a land of nightmares.
                                 Everything happens here.
                                 Someone blows out the sun; it's night.
                                And then, and then, oh, God, listen! This dragon, they say his
                                eyes are fire. His breath a white gas;
                                you can see him burn across the dark lands.
                                He runs with sulfur and thunder and kindles the grass.
                                Sheep panic and die insane. Women deliver forth monsters.
                                The dragon's fury is such that tower walls shake back to dust. His victims, at sunrise, are strewn hither thither on the hills. How many knights, I ask, have gone for this monster and
            failed, 
                                even as we shall fail?"
                            
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Enough of that!"
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "More than enough! Out here in this desolation I cannot tell what year this is!"
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Nine hundred years since
                                the Nativity."
                            
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "No, no," whispered the second man, eyes shut,"
                            On this moor is no
                                Time, is only
                                Forever. I feel if I ran back on the road
                                 the town would be gone, the people yet unborn, things changed, the
                                    castles unquarried from the rocks, the timbers still uncut from the forests
                                ; don't ask how I know; 
                                the moor knows and tells me
                                    . And here we sit alone in the land of the fire dragon, God save us!"
                            
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Be you afraid, then gird on your armor!"
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "What use? The dragon runs from nowhere; we cannot guess its home.
                                It vanishes in fog; we know not where it goes. Aye, on with our armor, we'll die well dressed."
                            
                        
         </p>
         <p>Half into his silver corselet, the second man stopped again and turned his head. Across the
                            dim country,
                            full of night and nothingness from the heart of the moor itself,
                                the wind sprang full of dust from clocks that used dust for telling time.
                            There were black suns burning in the heart of this new windand a million burnt leaves shaken from some autumn tree beyond the horizon.
                            This wind
                                    melted landscapes, lengthened bones
                                         like white wax, made the blood roil and thicken to a muddy deposit in the brain
                                    .
                                The wind was a thousand souls dying and all time confused and in transit. It was a fog inside of a mist inside of a darkness, and this place was no man's place and there was no year or hour at all,
            but only these men in a
                            faceless emptiness of sudden frost, storm and which moved behind the
                            white thunder great falling pane of green glass that was the lightning. A
                            squall of rain drenched the turf; all faded away until there was unbreathing hush and the two men waiting alone with their warmth in a cool
            season.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "There," whispered the first man.
                            "Oh,
                                there..."
                            
                        
         </p>
         <p>Miles off, rushing with
                            a great chant and a roar - the dragon.
                        
         </p>
         <p> In silence the men buckled on their armor 
                            and mounted their horses. The midnight wilderness was split by a monstrous gushing as the dragon roared
                            nearer, nearer; its flashing yellow glare spurted above a hill and then, fold on fold of dark body, 
                            distantly seen, therefore indistinct, flowed over that hill and plunged vanishing into a valley. 
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Quick!"
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            They spurred their horses forward to a small hollow.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "This is where
                                it passes!"
                            
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            They seized their lances with mailed fists and blinded their horses by flipping the visors down over their
            eyes.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Lord!"
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Yes, let us use
                                His name."
                            
                        
         </p>
         <p>On the instant, the dragon rounded a hill. Its monstrous amber eye fed on them, fired their armor in red glints and glitters.
            With a 
                            terrible wailing cry and a grinding rush
                            it flung itself forward.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Mercy, God!"
                        
         </p>
         <p>The lance struck under the unlidded yellow eye, buckled, tossed the man through the air. The dragon hit, spilled him over,
            down, ground him under. 
                            Passing, the black brunt of its shoulder smashed the remaining horse and rider a hundred feet against the
            side of a boulder,
                             wailing, wailing, the dragon shrieking, the fire all about, around, under
                            it, a pink, yellow, orange sun-fire with great soft plumes of blinding smoke.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Did you see it?" cried a 
                            voice. 
                            "Just like I told you!"
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            
                                "The same! The same! A 
                                knight in armor, by the Lord Harry! We hit him!"
                            
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "You goin' to stop?"
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Did once; found nothing. Don't like to stop on this moor. I get the willies. Got a feel, it has."
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "But we hit something!"
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Gave him plenty of whistle; chap wouldn't budge!"
                        
         </p>
         <p>A steaming blast cut the mist aside.</p>
         <p>
                            "We'll make
                                
                                    Stokely
                                 on time. More coal, eh,
                                Fred?"
                            
                        
         </p>
         <p>Another whistle shook dew from the empty sky. The night train, in
                            fire and fury, 
                            shot through a gully, up a rise, and vanished away
                             over cold earth toward the north, leaving black smoke and steam to dissolve in the numbed air minutes after 
                            it had passed and gone forever.

                            To enter out into that silence that was the city at eight o'clock of a 
                            misty evening in
                            November, to put your feet upon that buckling concrete walk,
                            to step over grassy seams and make your way, hands in pockets, through the silences, that was what 
                            Mr. Leonard Mead most dearly loved to do.
                            He would stand upon the corner of an intersection and peer down long moonlit avenues of 
                            sidewalk in four directions, deciding which way to go, but it really made no difference; 
                            he was alone in this world of 
                            A.D. 2053, or as good as alone, and with a final decision made,
                            a path selected
                            he would stride off, sending patterns of frosty air before him 
                            like the smoke of a cigar. 
                        
         </p>
         <p>Sometimes
                            he would walk for hours and miles and return only at midnight to his house. And on his way
                            he would see the cottages and homes with their dark windows, and it was not unequal to 
                            walking through a graveyard where only the faintest glimmers of firefly light appeared in flickers behind
            the windows. Sudden 
                            gray phantoms seemed to manifest upon inner room walls where a curtain 
                            was still undrawn against the night, or there were whisperings and murmurs where a window in a 
                            tomblike building was still open. 
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            Mr. Leonard Mead would 
                            pause, cock his head, listen, look, and march on, his feet making no noise on the 
                            lumpy walk. For long ago
                            he had wisely changed to sneakers when strolling at night, because the dogs in intermittent squads 
                            would parallel his journey with barkings if he wore hard heels and lights might click on and faces appear
            and an entire street be startled by the passing of a 
                            lone figure, himself, in the early 
                            November evening. 
                        
         </p>
         <p>On this particular evening 
                            he began his journey in a westerly direction, toward the hidden sea. There was a good 
                            crystal frost in the air;
                                
                                    it cut the nose and made the lungs blazelike a Christmas tree inside; you could feel the
                                cold light going on and off, all the 
                                branches filled with invisible snow
                            .
                            He listened to the faint push of his soft shoes through autumn leaves with satisfaction, and 
                            whistled a cold quiet
                            whistle between his teeth, occasionally picking up a leaf as
                            he passed, examining its skeletal pattern in the infrequent lamplights as 
                            he went on, smelling its rusty smell. 
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Hello, in there," 
                            he 
                            whispered to every house on every side as 
                            he moved.
                            "What's up tonight on 
                                Channel 4, Channel 7, Channel 9? Where are the cowboys rushing, and do I see 
                                
                                    
                                        the United States
                                    Cavalry
                                 over the next hill to the rescue?" 
                            
                        
         </p>
         <p>The street was 
                            silent and long and empty, with only his shadow moving 
                            like the shadow of a hawk in midcountry. If
                            he closed his eyes and stood very still, 
                            frozen, 
                            he could imagine himself upon the center of a plain, a wintry,
                             windless
                            
                                Arizona
                                desert
                            with no house in a thousand miles, and only 
                            dry river beds, the streets, for company. 
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "What is it now?"
                            he asked the
                            houses, noticing his wrist watch. 
                            "Eight-thirty P.M.? Time for a dozen assorted murders? A quiz? A revue? A comedian falling off the stage?"
                        
         </p>
         <p>Was that a 
                            murmur of laughter from within a moon-white house?
                            He hesitated, but went on when nothing more happened. 
                            He stumbled over a particularly uneven section of sidewalk. The cement was vanishing under flowers and grass.
                            In ten years of walking by night or day, for thousands of miles, 
                            he had never met another person walking, not once in all that time.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            He came to a cloverleaf intersection which 
                            stood silent where two main highways crossed the town. During the day it was a 
                            thunderous  surge of cars, the gas stations open, a great insect 
                            rustling and a ceaseless jockeying for position 
                            as the scarabbeetles, faint incense puttering from their exhausts, skimmed homeward 
                            to the far directions. But now these highways, too, were
                            like streams in a dry season, 
                            all stone and bed and moon radiance. 
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            He turned back on a side street, circling around toward his home.
                            He was within a block of his destination when the lone car turned a corner quite suddenly and flashed a fierce 
                            white cone of light upon him. 
                            He stood entranced, 
                            not unlike a night moth, stunned by the illumination, and then drawn toward it. 
                        
         </p>
         <p>A 
                            
                                metallic voice 
                             called to him: 
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Stand still. Stay where you are! Don't move!"
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            He halted.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Put up your hands!"
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            
                                "But-"
                            
                            he said.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Your hands up! Or we'll Shoot!"
                        
         </p>
         <p>The police, of course, but what a rare, incredible thing; in a city of three million, there was only one police car left,
            wasn't that correct? 
                            Ever since a year ago, 
                            2052, the election year, the force had been cut down from three cars to one. Crime was ebbing; there was no need now for the 
                            police, save for this one lone car 
                            wandering and wandering the empty streets.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Your name?" said the police car in a 
                            metallic
                            whisper.
                            He couldn't see the men in it for the bright light in his eyes.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            
                                "Leonard Mead,"
                            
                            he said.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Speak up!"
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            
                                "Leonard Mead!"
                            
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Business or profession?"
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "I guess you'd call me a writer."
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "No profession,"
                             said the 
                                police car, as if talking to itself. The light held him fixed,
                            like a museum specimen,
                            needle thrust through chest. 
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "You might say that," said 
                            Mr.  Mead.
                            He hadn't written in years. Magazines and books didn't sell any more. Everything went on in the 
                            tomblike houses at night now, 
                            he thought, continuing his fancy. 
                            The tombs, ill-lit by television light, where the people sat
                            like the dead, the gray or multicolored lights touching their faces, but never really touching 
                            them.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "No profession," said the 
                            phonograph voice, 
                            hissing.
                            "What are you doing out?"
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Walking," said 
                            Leonard  Mead.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Walking!"
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Just walking," 
                            he said simply, but his face felt cold.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            
                                "Walking, just walking, walking?"
                            
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Yes, sir."
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Walking where? For what?"
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            
                                "Walking for air. Walking to see."
                            
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Your address!"
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            
                                "Eleven South Saint James Street."
                            
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "And there is air in your house, you have an air conditioner,
                                Mr.   Mead?"
                            
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Yes."
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "And you have a
                                viewing screen in your house to see with?"
                            
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "No."
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "No?" There was a crackling quiet that in itself was an accusation.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Are you married,
                                Mr.  Mead?"
                            
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "No."
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Not married," said the 
                            police voice behind the fiery beam. The moon was high and clear among the stars and 
                            the houses were 
                            gray and silent.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Nobody wanted me," said 
                            Leonard Mead with a smile. 
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Don't speak unless you're spoken to!"
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            Leonard Mead waited in the cold night. 
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Just walking, 
                                Mr.  Mead?" 
                            
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Yes."
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "But you haven't explained for what purpose."
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "I explained; for air, and to see, and just to walk." 
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Have you done this often?"
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Every night for years."
                        
         </p>
         <p>The 
                            police car sat in the center of the street with its 
                            radio throat faintly humming.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Well, 
                                Mr.  Mead," 
                            
                            it said. 
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Is that all?"
                            he asked politely. 
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Yes," said the
                            voice.
                            "Here." There was a sigh, a pop. The back door of the police car sprang wide. 
                            "Get in."
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Wait a minute, I haven't done anything!"
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Get in."
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "I protest!"
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            
                                "Mr.  Mead." 
                            
                        
         </p>
         <p>He walked like a man suddenly drunk.
                            As
                                he passed the front window of the car he looked in. As 
                                he had expected, there was no one in the front seat, no one in the car at all
                            . 
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Get in."
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            He put his and to the door and peered into the back seat, which was a little cell, a little black 
                            jail with bars. 
                            It smelled of riveted steel. 
                                It smelled of harsh antiseptic; 
                                it smelled too clean and hard and metallic 
                            . There was nothing soft there.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Now if you had a wife to give you an alibi," said the 
                            iron voice. 
                            "
                                But-" 
                             
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Where are you taking me?"
                        
         </p>
         <p>The
                            car hesitated, or rather gave a faint 
                                whirring click
                            , as if information, somewhere, was dropping card by punch-slotted card under 
                            electric eyes.
                            "To 
                                the Psychiatric Center for Research on Regressive Tendencies."
                            
                        
         </p>
         <p>He got in. The door shut with a soft thud. The police car rolled through the night avenues, flashing its dim lights ahead.</p>
         <p>They passed one house on one street a moment later, one house in an entire city of houses that were dark, but this one particular
            house had all 
                            of its electric lights brightly lit, every window a loud yellow illumination, square and warm in the
                            cool darkness.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "That's my house," said 
                            Leonard Mead. 
                        
         </p>
         <p>No one answered him.</p>
         <p>The car moved down the empty 
                            river-bed streets and off away, leaving the empty streets with the empty side-walks, 
                            and no sound and no motion all the rest of the chill 
                            November night.
