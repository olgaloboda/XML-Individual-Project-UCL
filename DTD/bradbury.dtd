<!-- 
    As the tags' category is known (in this example, it is trope), the attribute's value is fixed. 
    Attribute 'category' allows extracting by means of xslt either all tropes or figures of speech without enumerating all possible tropes or figures from the document. 
    'Device' allows extracting all tropes and figures simultaneously, and, it also shows another way of embedding fixed content. Usually this way is used to provide several predefined options to the content.
    'Ref' helps to extract xslt content of, for example, 'epithet' with the relation to what epithet refers.
