                            <span style="color:#FF0000">To enter out into that silence</span> that was the city at eight o'clock of a 
                            <span style="color:#B8B894">misty</span> evening in
                            November, to put your feet upon that buckling concrete walk,
                            <span style="color:#FF0000">to step over grassy seams and make your way, hands in pockets, through the silences</span>, that was what 
                            Mr. Leonard Mead most dearly loved to do.
                            <span style="color:#009999" class="bold">He</span> would stand upon the corner of an intersection and peer down long moonlit avenues of 
                            sidewalk in four directions, deciding which way to go, but it really made no difference; 
                            <span style="color:#009999" class="bold">he</span> was alone in this world of 
                            A.D. 2053, or as good as alone, and with a final decision made,
                            a path selected
                            <span style="color:#009999" class="bold">he</span> would stride off, sending patterns of frosty air before him 
                            <span style="color:#FF9900">like the smoke of a cigar</span>. 
                        
         </p>
         <p>Sometimes
                            <span style="color:#009999" class="bold">he</span> would walk for hours and miles and return only at midnight to his house. And on his way
                            <span style="color:#009999" class="bold">he</span> would see the cottages and homes with their dark windows, and it was not unequal to 
                            walking through a graveyard where only the faintest glimmers of firefly light appeared in flickers behind
            the windows. Sudden 
                            <span style="color:#00CC99">gray phantoms</span> seemed to manifest upon inner room walls where a curtain 
                            was still undrawn against the night, or there were whisperings and murmurs where a window in a 
                            <span style="color:#B8B894">tomblike</span> building was still open. 
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            Mr. Leonard Mead would 
                            <span style="color:#FF0066">pause, cock his head, listen, look, and march on</span>, his feet making no noise on the 
                            <span style="color:#B8B894">lumpy</span> walk. For long ago
                            <span style="color:#009999" class="bold">he</span> had wisely changed to sneakers when strolling at night, because the dogs in intermittent squads 
                            would parallel his journey with barkings if he wore hard heels and lights might click on and faces appear
            and an entire street be startled by the passing of a 
                            <span style="color:#00CC99">lone figure</span>, himself, in the early 
                            November evening. 
                        
         </p>
         <p>On this particular evening 
                            <span style="color:#009999" class="bold">he</span> began his journey in a westerly direction, toward the hidden sea. There was a good 
                            <span style="color:#FF0000">crystal frost in the air;
                                   
                                       it cut the nose and made the lungs blazelike a Christmas tree inside; you could feel the
                                   cold light going on and off, all the 
                                   branches filled with invisible snow
                               </span>.
                            <span style="color:#009999" class="bold">He</span> listened to the faint push of his soft shoes through autumn leaves with satisfaction, and 
                            <span style="color:#FF75A3">whistled</span> a cold quiet
                            <span style="color:#FF75A3">whistle</span> between his teeth, occasionally picking up a leaf as
                            <span style="color:#009999" class="bold">he</span> passed, examining its skeletal pattern in the infrequent lamplights as 
                            <span style="color:#009999" class="bold">he</span> went on, smelling its rusty smell.

                            "Hello, in there,"

                            <span style="color:#FF75A3">whispered</span> to every house on every side as

                            "What's up tonight on

                            with no house in a thousand miles, and only 
                            <span style="color:#00CC99">dry river beds</span>, the streets, for company.

                            "What is it now?"
                            he asked the
                            <span style="color:#009900">houses</span>, noticing his wrist watch. 
                            "Eight-thirty P.M.? Time for a dozen assorted murders? A quiz? A revue? A comedian falling off the stage?"
                        
         </p>
         <p>Was that a 
                            <span style="color:#FF75A3">murmur</span> of laughter from within a moon-white house?
                            He hesitated, but went on when nothing more happened. 
                            He stumbled over a particularly uneven section of sidewalk. The cement was vanishing under flowers and grass.
                            In ten years of walking by night or day, for thousands of miles, 
                            he had never met another person walking, not once in all that time.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            He came to a cloverleaf intersection which 
                            <span style="color:#FF0000">stood silent</span> where two main highways crossed the town. During the day it was a 
                            <span style="color:#B8B894">thunderous </span> surge of cars, the gas stations open, a great insect 
                            rustling and a ceaseless jockeying for position 
                            <span style="color:#FF9900">as the scarabbeetles</span>, faint incense puttering from their exhausts, skimmed homeward 
                            to the far directions. But now these highways, too, were
                            <span style="color:#FF9900">like streams in a dry season</span>, 
                            <span style="color:#7575A3">all stone and bed and moon radiance</span>. 
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            He turned back on a side street, circling around toward his home.
                            He was within a block of his destination when the lone car turned a corner quite suddenly and flashed a fierce 
                            white cone of light upon him. 
                            He stood entranced, 
                            <span style="color:#FF9900">not unlike a night moth</span>, stunned by the illumination, and then drawn toward it. 
                        
         </p>
         <p>A 
                            <span style="color:#009900">
                                   metallic voice 
                               </span> called to him:

         <p>
                            "Stand still. Stay where you are! Don't move!"
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            He halted.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Put up your hands!"

         <p>

                            he said.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Your hands up! Or we'll Shoot!"
                        
         </p>
         <p>The police, of course, but what a rare, incredible thing; in a city of three million, there was only one police car left,
            wasn't that correct? 
                            Ever since a year ago, 
                            2052, the election year, the force had been cut down from three cars to one. Crime was ebbing; there was no need now for the 
                            police, save for this one lone car 
                            wandering and wandering the empty streets.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Your name?" said the police car in a

                            <span style="color:#FF75A3">whisper</span>.
                            <span style="color:#009999" class="bold">He</span> couldn't see the men in it for the bright light in his eyes.

                            <span style="color:#FF9900">like so many roses, so many weeds</span>, intermixed, peering out for a look at the hidden sun.
                            
         </p>
         <p>It rained.</p>
         <p>It had been raining for seven years; thousands upon thousands of days compounded and filled from one end to the other with
            rain, 
                            with the drum and gush of water, with the 
                            <span style="color:#B8B894">sweet crystal</span> fall of showers and the concussion of storms so heavy they were 
                            tidal waves come over the islands. A thousand forests had been crushed under the rain and grown up a thousand
            times to be crushed again. 
                            <span style="color:#B88A00">And this was the way life was forever on the planet

               and 
                                   live out their lives

                            Margot stood apart from
                            <span style="color:#00CCFF" class="bold">them</span>, from these children who could ever remember a time when there wasn't
                            rain and rain and rain. 
                            <span style="color:#00CCFF" class="bold">They</span> were all nine years old, and if there had been a day, seven years ago, when
                            <span style="color:#FF0000">the sun came out for an hour and showed its face</span> to the 
                            <span style="color:#B8B894">stunned</span> world, they could not recall. Sometimes, at night,
                            <span style="color:#D119A3" class="bold">she</span> heard them stir, in remembrance, and 
                            <span style="color:#B88A00">she knew
                                   they were
                                   dreaming and rememberinggold or a yellow crayon or a coin large enough to buy the world with
                                   .
                                   She knew
                                   they thought
                                   they remembered a warmness, like a blushing
                                   in the face, in the body, in the arms and legs and trembling hands</span>. But then
                            <span style="color:#00CCFF" class="bold">they</span> always awoke to the 
                            <span style="color:#FF75A3">tatting</span> drum, the endless shaking down of clear bead necklaces upon
                            <span style="color:#FF0066">the roof, the walk, the gardens,
                                   the forests, and their dreams</span>were gone.
                        
         </p>
         <p>All day yesterday
                            <span style="color:#00CCFF" class="bold">they</span> had read in class about the sun. About how
                            <span style="color:#FF9900">like a lemon</span> it was, and how hot. And 
                            <span style="color:#00CCFF" class="bold">they</span> had written small stories or essays or poems about it: 
                            <span style="font-style:italic;">I think
                               the sun is a flower, That blooms for just one hour
                               </span>. That was
                            Margot's poem, read in a quiet voice in the still classroom while the rain was falling outside.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Aw, you didn't write that!" protested one of the boys.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "I did," said 
                            Margot. 
                            "I did."  
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            
                                "William!"
                             said the teacher.
                        
         </p>
         <p>But that was yesterday. Now the rain was slackening, and the children were crushed in the great thick windows.</p>
         <p>
                            "Where's teacher?"
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            
                                "She'll be back."
                                            
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            
                                "She'd better hurry, we'll miss it!"
                            
                        
         </p>
         <p>They turned on themselves,
                            <span style="color:#FF9900">like a feverish wheel</span>, all tumbling spokes.
                            Margot stood alone.
                            <span style="color:#476B6B">She was a very frail girl who looked as if she had been lost in the rain for years and the rain had washed out
                                   the blue from her eyes and the red from her mouth and the yellow from her hair</span>.
                            <span style="color:#FF0000">She was an old photograph dusted from an album, whitened away
                               </span>, and if she spoke at all her
                            would be a ghost. Now she stood, separate, staring at the rain and the
                            <span style="color:#7575A3">loud wet</span> world beyond the huge glass.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "What're <span style="font-style:italic;">you</span> looking at?" said
                            William.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            Margot said nothing.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Speak when you're spoken to."
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            He gave her a shove. But 
                            <span style="color:#D119A3" class="bold">she</span> did not move; rather
                            <span style="color:#D119A3" class="bold">she</span> let herself be moved only by him and nothing else.
                            <span style="color:#00CCFF" class="bold">They</span> edged away from her,
                            <span style="color:#00CCFF" class="bold">they</span> would not look at her.
                            <span style="color:#D119A3" class="bold">She</span> felt them go away. And this was because 
                            <span style="color:#D119A3" class="bold">she</span> would play no games with them in the echoing tunnels of the underground city. If they tagged her and ran, 
                            she stood 
                            <span style="color:#FF75A3">blinking</span> after them and did not follow. When the class sang songs about
                            <span style="color:#FF0066">happiness and life and games</span> her lips barely moved.
                            Only when they sang about the sun and the summer did her lips move as she watched the drenched windows. And
            then, of course, the biggest crime of all was that
                            <span style="color:#D119A3" class="bold">she</span> had come here only five years ago from
                            
                                Earth
                            , and 
                            <span style="color:#D119A3" class="bold">she</span> remembered the sun and the way the sun was and the sky was when she was four in
                            
                                Ohio
                            .
                            <span style="color:#B88A00"> And 
                                   
                                       they,
                                       they
                                   had been on
                                   
                                       Venus
                                    all their lives, and 
                                   
                                       they 
                                       they
                                   had been only two years old when last the sun came out and had long since forgotten the
                                   color and heat of it and the way it really was
                               </span>.
                        
         </p>
         <p>But 
                            Margot remembered.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "It's
                                <span style="color:#FF9900">like a penny</span>,"
                            
                            <span style="color:#D119A3" class="bold">she</span> said once, eyes closed.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "No it's not!" the children cried.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "It's
                                <span style="color:#FF9900">like a fire</span>,"
                            
                            <span style="color:#D119A3" class="bold">she</span> said,
                            "in the stove."
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "You're lying, you don't remember!" cried the children.
                        
         </p>
         <p>But 
                            <span style="color:#D119A3" class="bold">she</span> remembered and stood quietly apart from all of them and watched the patterning windows. And once, a month ago,
                            <span style="color:#D119A3" class="bold">she</span> had refused to shower in the school shower rooms, had clutched her hands to her ears and over her head, 
                            screaming the water mustn't touch her head. So after that,
                            dimly, dimly,
                            <span style="color:#D119A3" class="bold">she</span> sensed it,
                            <span style="color:#D119A3" class="bold">she</span> was different and
                            <span style="color:#00CCFF" class="bold">they</span> knew her difference and kept away. There was talk that her father and mother were taking her back to
                            
                                Earth
                             next year; it seemed vital to her that
                            they do so,though it would mean the loss of thousands of dollars to her family. And so, 
                            the children hated her for all these reasons of big and little consequence. 
                            <span style="color:#00CCFF" class="bold">They</span> hated her
                            <span style="color:#FF0066">pale
                                       snow face, her waiting silence, her thinness, and her possible future

         </p>
         <p>
                            "Get away!" The boy gave her another push. 
                            "What're you waiting for?"
                        
         </p>
         <p>Then, for the first time,
                            <span style="color:#D119A3" class="bold">she</span> turned and looked at him. And 
                            <span style="color:#FF0000">what
                                   she was waiting for was in her eyes
                               </span>.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Well, don't wait around here!" cried the boy savagely.
                            "You won't see nothing!"
                        
         </p>
         <p>Her lips moved.</p>
         <p>
                            "Nothing!"
                            he cried.
                            "It was all a joke, wasn't it?"
                             He turned to the other children.
                            "Nothing's happening today. <span style="font-style:italic;">Is</span> it?"
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            <span style="color:#00CCFF" class="bold">They</span> all 
                            <span style="color:#FF75A3">blinked</span> at him and then, understanding, laughed and shook their heads.
                        
         </p>

                            "Oh, but,"

                            "All a joke!" said the boy, and seized her roughly.
                            "Hey, everyone, let's put her in a closet before the teacher comes!"

                            "No," said
                            Margot, falling back.

                            "Ready, children?"
                            She glanced at her watch.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Yes!" said everyone.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Are we all here?"
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Yes!"

         <p>The rain slacked still more.</p>
         <p>
                            <span style="color:#00CCFF" class="bold">They</span> crowded to the huge door.

         <p>The rain stopped.</p>
         <p>It was as if, in the midst of a film concerning
                            <span style="color:#FF0066">an avalanche, a tornado, a hurricane, a volcanic eruption</span>,
                            <span style="color:#CC00FF">something had, first, gone wrong with the sound apparatus, thus 
                                   muffling and finally cutting off 
                                   all noise, all of the blasts and repercussions and thunders</span>, and then, second, ripped the film from the projector and inserted in its place 
                            a beautiful tropical slide which did not move or tremor. The world ground to a standstill. The silence was
            so immense and unbelievable that you 
                            felt your ears had been stuffed or you had lost your hearing altogether. The children put their hands to their
            ears.
                            <span style="color:#00CCFF" class="bold">They</span> stood apart.
                            The door slid back and
                            <span style="color:#FF0000">the smell of the silent, waiting world came in to them</span>.
         </p>
         <p>The sun came out.</p>
         <p>
                            <span style="color:#FF3300" class="bold">It</span> was the color of flaming bronze and
                            <span style="color:#FF3300" class="bold">it</span> was very large. And the sky around
                            <span style="color:#FF3300" class="bold">it</span> was a blazing blue tile color. And
                            <span style="color:#FF0000">the jungle burned with sunlight</span> as the children,
                            <span style="color:#FF0000">released from their spell</span>, rushed out, yelling into the springtime.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Now, don't go too far," called the teacher after them.
                            "You've only two hours, you know. You wouldn't want to get caught out!"
                        
         </p>
         <p>But 
                            <span style="color:#B88A00">they were running and turning their faces up to the sky and feeling the sun on their cheeks

                                   they were taking off their jackets and
                                   letting the sun burn their arms</span>.

         <p>
                            "Oh, it's better than the sun lamps, isn't it?"
                        
         </p>
         <p>

         <p>
                            <span style="color:#00CCFF" class="bold">They</span> stopped running and stood in the great jungle that covered

                            <span style="color:#B88A00">It was a nest of octopi, clustering up great arms of

                                    It was the color of rubber and ash, this
                                   jungle, from the many years without sun.
                                   It was the color of stones and white cheeses and ink, and 
                                   it was the color of the moon
                               </span>.

         <p>The children lay out, laughing, on the

         <p>In the midst of their running one of the girls wailed.</p>
         <p>Everyone stopped.</p>
         <p>The girl, standing in the open, held out her hand.</p>
         <p>
                            "Oh,

                            she said, trembling.

         <p>
                            <span style="color:#00CCFF" class="bold">They</span> came slowly to look at her opened palm.
                        
         </p>
         <p>In the center of
                            it,
                            <span style="color:#B8B894">cupped</span> and huge, was a single raindrop.
                            She began to cry, looking at
                            it.
                            <span style="color:#00CCFF" class="bold">They</span> glanced quietly at the sun.

         </p>
         <p>A few cold drops fell on their noses and their cheeks and their mouths. The sun faded behind a stir of mist. A wind blew cold
            around them.
                            <span style="color:#00CCFF" class="bold">They</span> turned and started to walk back toward the underground house, their hands at their sides, their smiles 
                            vanishing away.
                        
         </p>
         <p>A boom of thunder startled them and
                            <span style="color:#FF9900">like leaves before a new hurricane</span>,
                            <span style="color:#00CCFF" class="bold">they</span> tumbled upon each other and ran.
                            <span style="color:#CC00FF">Lightning struck ten miles away, five miles away, a mile, a half mile</span>. The sky darkened into 
                            midnight in a flash.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            <span style="color:#00CCFF" class="bold">They</span> stood in the doorway of the underground for a moment until it was raining hard. Then

         <p>
                            "Will it be seven more years?"

         <p>Then one of them gave a little cry.</p>

         <p>
                            <span style="color:#00CCFF" class="bold">They</span> stood as if someone had driven them,

                            <span style="color:#B88A00">They looked at each other and then looked away.

                                   They could not meet each other's glances. Their faces were
                                   solemn and pale.
                                   They looked at their hands and feet, their faces down

         <p>One of the girls said,

         <p>The night blew in the short grass on the moor; there was no other motion.

                            They waited a long time, but there was only the shake of their horses'

                                <span style="color:#FF0000">eyes are fire</span>. His breath a white gas;
                                you can see him burn across the dark lands.

         <p>Half into his silver corselet, the second man stopped again and turned his head. Across the
                            <span style="color:#B8B894">dim</span> country,
                            <span style="color:#FF0000">full of night and nothingness from the heart of the moor itself,
                                   the wind sprang full of dust from clocks that used dust for telling time</span>.
                            <span style="color:#FF0000">There were black suns burning in the heart of this new wind</span>and a million burnt leaves shaken from some autumn tree beyond the horizon.
                            <span style="color:#B88A00">This wind
                                       melted landscapes, lengthened bones

                                       .
                                   The wind was a thousand souls dying and all time confused and in transit</span>. It was a fog inside of a mist inside of a darkness, and this place was no man's place and there was no year or hour at all,
            but only these men in a
                            <span style="color:#B8B894">faceless</span> emptiness of sudden frost, storm and which moved behind the
                            <span style="color:#00CC99">white thunder</span> great falling pane of green glass that was the lightning. A
                            <span style="color:#FF0000">squall of rain</span> drenched the turf; all faded away until there was unbreathing hush and the two men waiting alone with their warmth in a cool
            season.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "There," whispered the first man.
                            "Oh,
                                there..."
                            
                        
         </p>
         <p>Miles off, rushing with
                            <span style="color:#CC00FF">a great chant and a roar</span> - the dragon.
                        
         </p>
         <p> In silence the men buckled on their armor 
                            and mounted their horses. The midnight wilderness was split by a monstrous gushing as the dragon roared
                            nearer, nearer; its flashing yellow glare spurted above a hill and then, fold on fold of dark body, 
                            distantly seen, therefore indistinct, flowed over that hill and plunged vanishing into a valley. 
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Quick!"
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            They spurred their horses forward to a small hollow.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "This is where
                                <span style="color:#33CC33" class="bold">it</span> passes!"
                            
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            They seized their lances with mailed fists and blinded their horses by flipping the visors down over their
            eyes.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Lord!"
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Yes, let us use
                                His name."
                            
                        
         </p>
         <p>On the instant, the dragon rounded a hill. Its monstrous amber eye fed on them, fired their armor in red glints and glitters.
            With a 
                            terrible wailing cry and a grinding rush
                            <span style="color:#33CC33" class="bold">it</span> flung itself forward.
                        
         </p>
         <p>
                            "Mercy, God!"
                        
         </p>
         <p>The lance struck under the unlidded yellow eye, buckled, tossed the man through the air. The dragon hit, spilled him over,
            down, ground him under. 
                            Passing, the black brunt of its shoulder smashed the remaining horse and rider a hundred feet against the
            side of a boulder,
                             wailing, wailing, the dragon shrieking, the fire all about, around, under
                            <span style="color:#33CC33" class="bold">it</span>, a pink, yellow, orange sun-fire with great soft plumes of blinding smoke.

         <p>
                            "Did you see it?" cried a 
                            <span style="color:#009900">voice</span>. 
                            "Just like I told you!"

         <p>Another whistle shook dew from the empty sky. The night train, in
                            <span style="color:#7575A3">fire and fury</span>, 
                            <span style="color:#FF0066">shot through a gully, up a rise, and vanished away
                               </span> over cold earth toward the north, leaving black smoke and steam to dissolve in the numbed air minutes after 
                            it had passed and gone forever.
