            <p> In silence the men buckled on their armor 
                and mounted their horses. The midnight wilderness was split by a monstrous gushing as the dragon roared
                <repetition device="rhetorical">nearer, nearer;</repetition> its flashing yellow glare spurted above a hill and then, fold on fold of dark body, 
                distantly seen, therefore indistinct, flowed over that hill and plunged vanishing into a valley.

                They spurred their horses forward to a small hollow.

            <p>
                They seized their lances with mailed fists and blinded their horses by flipping the visors down over their eyes.

            </p>

            <p>On the instant, the dragon rounded a hill. Its monstrous amber eye fed on them, fired their armor in red glints and glitters. With a 
                terrible wailing cry and a grinding rush

            <p>The lance struck under the unlidded yellow eye, buckled, tossed the man through the air. The dragon hit, spilled him over, down, ground him under. 
                Passing, the black brunt of its shoulder smashed the remaining horse and rider a hundred feet against the side of a boulder,
